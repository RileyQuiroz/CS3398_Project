## Description
> We are creating a bullethell-style game using Python and Pygame. The game will feature fast-paced, challenging gameplay where the player must dodge a constant barrage of enemy bullets while aiming to defeat enemies and complete levels.
> The game is designed for gamers who enjoy high-intensity, skill-based gameplay. Our target audience includes fans of the bullethell genre and players who are looking for a challenging and immersive experience.
> We are developing this game to provide an exciting and engaging gaming experience that tests players' reflexes and strategic thinking. We hope to create a game that challenges the player while offering a sense of achievement as they progress through increasingly difficult levels.
